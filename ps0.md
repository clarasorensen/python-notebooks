# Problem Set 0

Follow [the instructions in the problem set](http://wellesleynlp.github.io/machinelearning/ps0.html) to install Python, the required libraries, and Git.

Clone this repository and run all code locally. 
You need not fork this repository unless you want to write new code and commit it for your own personal use. 

First, execute `check.py` to ensure that the required libraries are installed.

Next, open the `python-tutorial.ipynb` notebook and walk yourself through the tutorial.
Canopy users can open the notebook directly in Canopy; others should execute 

    jupyter notebook

from the current directory and open the file from the browser window that pops up.

At the minimum, you should read everything in the notebook, run all the cells and convince yourself of how the code works. 
If you have time, you may also play around with code and experiment.
