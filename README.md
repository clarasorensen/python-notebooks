# iPython Notebooks for Machine Learning

Contains the collection of tutorials, demos, etc. that we use for the [machine learning](http://wellesleynlp.github.io/machinelearning/) course.

This repository used to be `ps0` but has been generalized. You can continue to pull into your local `ps0` clone without changing anything.
